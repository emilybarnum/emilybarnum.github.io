        <p class="description">Original Mobile ID App</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>
            From August to December 2022, I had the opportunity to
            research user issues with the current JMU Mobile ID App
            and redesign the app using Figma. Through observation and research, I
            concluded that the current Mobile ID App interface is outdated, confusing to navigate, and buggy.
            I wanted to create an interface that removed all of the confusing
            location codes, simplified the scanning process, and added a feature
            for loading money into a dining plan.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Project Overview</h5>
        <p>
            Mobile ID is an application that allows users to purchase items, access facilities
            around campus, and check meal plan balances. This app is generally used by students who
            want the convenience of paying for meals at dining halls or swiping in and out of buildings from
            the convenience of their smartphone. Most students already have their phones out when waiting
            in lines to purchase their lunch or access the University Recreation Facilities. The convenience factor
            provided by Mobile ID
            is the app's greatest selling point.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Gathering Requirements</h5>
        <p>
            Information gathering was conducted using in-person interviews, naturalistic observation, and a Google
            survey.
            Naturalistic observation of students' usage of Mobile ID in dining hall lines gave a
            general sense that students preferred the app over swiping their JMU Access Cards.
            Furthermore, in-person interviews with users confirmed these naturalistic observations.
            Users of the app enjoy the utility it provides. When asked what they would change, most
            responses focused on the usability of the interface and the aesthetics of the interface. Many users stated
            the app appeared outdated. Some complained about the buggy interface. One user described
            his experience with a glitchy interface that made it impossible to purchase food during his
            Freshman year. Additionally, users described the annoyance of having to click on the MyInfo
            button before scanning the QR code. Another user agreed and added that the small size of the
            QR code made it difficult for the scanner to read at times. Furthermore, many users had no idea
            where to look for recent transactions on the app. A minority of people suggested extra features
            should be added such as printing functionality and the ability to add money to flex from the app.
            Using the Google survey, I compiled 16 user responses from a number of questions
            about the app. The general sentiment from this population was that the app performed its
            intended purpose but could use additional functionality and design could be greatly improved.
            These online responses mirrored the responses collected in-person during the initial interview
            process.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the research conducted, I decided these changes should be prioritized:
        </p>
        <h6>
            Functional Changes
        </h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Add functionality to use current location</li>
            <li>Add functionality to save favorite locations</li>
            <li>Add functionality to increase Flex balance</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>
            Aesthetic Changes
        </h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Use JMU colors</li>
            <li>Improve navigation</li>
            <li>Add modals for scanning</li>
            <li>Remove confusing location codes</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h5>Lo-Fi Prototype</h5>
        <p>
            Based on the information gathered, I created a low fidelity prototype to address the issues presented.
            In this prototype, I outlined the basic functionality, layout, and interactions. This prototype went
            through many revisions before landing on the final high fidelity prototype made using Figma.

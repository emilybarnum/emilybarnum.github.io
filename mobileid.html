            <p class="description">Original Mobile ID App</p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>From August to December 2022, I had the opportunity to 
                research user issues with the current JMU Mobile ID App 
                and redesign the app using Figma. Through observation and research, I
                concluded that the current Mobile ID App interface is outdated, confusing to navigate, and buggy.
                I wanted to create an interface that removed all of the confusing
                location codes, simplified the scanning process, and added a feature 
                for loading money into a dining plan.
            </p>
            <h5>Project Overview</h5>
            <p>
                Mobile ID is a phone based app which enables users to purchase items, access facilities
                around campus, and check meal plan balances. This app is generally used by students who
                want the convenience of paying for meals at dining halls or swiping in and out of buildings from
                the convenience of their smartphone. Most students already have their phones out when waiting
                in lines to purchase their lunch or access the University Recreation Facilities. The convenience factor provided by Mobile ID
                is the app's greatest selling point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information gathering was conducted using in-person interviews, naturalistic observation, and a Google survey.
                Naturalistic observation of students' usage of Mobile ID in dining hall lines gave a
                general sense that students preferred the app over swiping their JA Cards.
                Furthermore, in-person interviews with users confirmed these naturalistic observations.
                Users of the app enjoy the utility it provides. When asked what they would change, most
                responses focused on the usability of the interface and the aesthetics of the interface. Many users stated
                the app appeared outdated. Some complained about the buggy interface. One user described
                his experience with a glitchy interface that made it impossible to purchase food during his
                Freshman year. Additionally, users described the annoyance of having to click on the MyInfo
                button before scanning the QR code. Another user agreed and added that the small size of the
                QR code made it difficult for the scanner to read at times. Furthermore, many users had no idea
                where to look for recent transactions on the app. A minority of people suggested extra features
                should be added such as printing functionality and the ability to add money to flex from the app.
                Using the Google survey, we compiled 16 user responses from a number of questions
                about the app. The general sentiment from this population was that the app performed its
                intended purpose but could use additional functionality and design could be greatly improved.
                These online responses mirrored the responses collected in-person during the initial interview
                process.

            <p>
                Based on the information gathered, I created a low fidelity prototype to address the issues presented.
